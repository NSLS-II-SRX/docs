Controls Account Setup Guide
============================

Introduction
------------

NSLS-II controls accounts allow access to all computers at CSX. Once a new
account has been created, the following is suggested to get the account working
correctly. 

Fixing Permissions
------------------

Firstly, all accounts are created with global read permissions. If this is OK
by you then skip the next step. However, if you want to restict access to files
in your home directory then do the following: ::

    [swilkins@xf23id1-srv2 ~ ]$ chmod o-rwx,g-w+rx,u+rwx /home/<uid>

Setting up an SSH Key
---------------------

Create the RSA Key Pair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to create an SSH key pair in your home directory: ::

    ssh-keygen -t rsa

the ``ssh-keygen`` command will ask you a few questions: ::

    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):

You can press enter here, saving the file to the user home (in this case, the
user is called demo). ::

    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

You should enter a passphrase. The security of a key, no matter how encrypted,
still depends on the fact that it is not visible to anyone else. Should a
passphrase-protected private key fall into an unauthorized users possession,
they will be unable to log in to its associated accounts until they figure out
the passphrase.

The entire key generation process looks like this: ::

    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa): 
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
    Enter same passphrase again: 
    Your identification has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    4a:dd:0a:c6:35:4e:3f:ed:27:38:8c:74:44:4d:93:67 demo@a
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |          .oo.   |
    |         .  o.E  |
    |        + .  o   |
    |     . = = .     |
    |      = S = .    |
    |     o + = +     |
    |      . o + o .  |
    |           . o   |
    |                 |
    +-----------------+
    The public key is now located in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub The private key
    (identification) is now located in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy the Public Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the key pair is generated, you can now install it on the controls system
to allow access. This can be done with the ``ssh-copy-id`` command: ::

    ssh-copy-id user@box64-2

where ``user`` is your username. If sucsessful, You should see something like: ::

    [swilkins@xf23id1-srv2 ~/Scratch ]$ ssh-copy-id swilkins@box64-2

    Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'swilkins@box64-2'", and check in:

      ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

    to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.

Now you are done ... you should be able to login using SSH kets now.
